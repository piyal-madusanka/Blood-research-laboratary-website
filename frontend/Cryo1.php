                           <p style="color: white;" >  Cryo is manufactured from Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) collected from whole blood donation. Fresh Frozen Plasma is plasma frozen within 8 hours of collection. 
FFP of the same ABO is slowly thawed at 1-6°C until a slightly slushy consistency is achieved. This can be done by thawing in a refrigerator for 18-24 hours or a few hours in a circulating water bath. Here we have a FFP pulled from a water bath. Circled are precipitates that are visible prior to centrifugation. They are opaque white in appearance.
Once the plasma is thawed, the liquid plasma is separated from the cryoprecipitate by centrifugation, utilizing a “heavy” spin. This is done to concentrate the precipitates to the bottom of the bag.  The precipitates will have a thick, white to opaqueish consistency. It can be mistaken as a fibrin clot.
After centrifugation, the supernatant is removed by gravity drain or plasma expressor. Approximately 10-15mL of supernatant plasma remains with the cryoprecipitate and is used to re-suspend the precipitates. At this point the cryo may be refrozen immediately or pooled.   Both cryo-poor plasma and recovered plasma are deficient of those cryo factors. Cryo-poor plasma is an injectable product that is typically used for plasma exchange. Recovered plasma is an unlicensed product that can be shipped to manufactures of plasma products.
To create a pool, single cryo are welded onto a pooling harness bag set. The process of welding is sterile and allows the product to be a closed system. The single cryo are pooled to provide a single, combined therapeutically effective blood product, a cryoprecipitate pool.  Pictured is a 5-unit pool.

                            <p style="color: white;"> Cryoprecipitate was used to treat patients with hemophilia in the past, but this is no longer necessary due to the development of factor‐specific products. Cryoprecipitate is now primarily used to replace fibrinogen (below 100 mg/dl). Cryoprecipitate does not need to be type‐specific because it has such little plasma. However, hemolysis can occur after large volumes of cryoprecipitate have been given. Each unit of cryoprecipitate will raise the fibrinogen level 5–10 mg/dl. A typical dose is 10 units. Cryoprecipitate is indicated for the treatment of fibrinogen deficiency or disfibrinogenaemia when there is clinical bleeding, an invasive procedure, trauma or disseminated intravascular coagulation. 
                            <br> <h5 style="color: white;">Safety Tips</h5>  
                            <p style="color: white;">The routine uses of cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate in medical or critically ill patients with coagulopathy is not advised. The underlying causes of coagulopathy should be identified.<br> 
                            In maternity patients with abnormal coagulation tests who are not bleeding (note: concealed bleeding should be excluded), the routine use of cryoprecipitate or FFP is not supported. There was no evidence to define a threshold fibrinogen level or prothrombin ratio/INR that is associated with significant adverse events.<br>
                            There is increasing requirements for fibrinogen supplementation, usually supplied as cryoprecipitate, during massive transfusion based on point-of-care testing ( eg thromboelastography ).If in doubt, discuss with your Haematologist or a Medical Officer.</p>

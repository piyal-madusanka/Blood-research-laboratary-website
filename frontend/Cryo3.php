                            <p style="color:white; " >
                            Typically one unit of whole blood derived cryoprecipitate per 5-10 kg body weight would be expected to increase the fibrinogen concentration by 0.5-1.0 g/L and one unit of apheresis derived cryoprecipitate by approximately twice this much.
                            The recommended dose is 1 standard adult dose which consists of 10 whole blood cryoprecipitate or 5 apheresis cryoprecipitate which would provide 3-4g of fibrinogen.
                            In patients with critical bleeding requiring massive transfusion, suggested doses of cryoprecipitate are 3–4 g or as outlined in the local Massive Transfusion Protocol. (Module 1) or local clinical protocols.
                            Cryoprecipitate contains at least 80 IU of factor VIII and 150 mg of fibrinogen per unit, although most units actually contain about 200 mg of fibrinogen. Other components include VWF, factor XIII, and fibronectin. Many blood banks order pre-pooled cryoprecipitate, which comes in pools of 5 or 6 units, whereas other banks pool their own product. A typical adult dose is 10–15 units of cryoprecipitate (2–3 pools), which in a 70-kg adult will raise the fibrinogen level by 70–80 mg/dl. A frequent mistake is the ordering of a single 5-unit pool of cryoprecipitate to treat an adult. It is important to understand the product available at your institution for appropriate dosing.
                            <h5>Fibrinogen replacement </h5>
                            <p style="color: white;">Dose (units) = (Desired fibrinogen increment [mg/dL] × Plasma Volume)/250 mg/unit
                            Plasma Volume = ([1 − HCT] × 0.7 dL/kg × Weight [kg])</p>

                            <h5>ABO/D Compatibility</h5>
                            <p style="color: white;"></p>
                            <p style="color: white;">   Since cryoprecipitate contains negligible amounts of RBCs and minimal isohemagglutinins, anti-A and/or anti-B, choosing units with ABO or D compatibility is not necessary for most adult and pediatric patients; neonatal transfusion guidelines often recommend the use of ABO compatible cryoprecipitate.</p>
                         
                            <h5>Thawing and Pooling</h5>
                              <p style="color: white;"> Cryoprecipitate takes 10–15 minutes to thaw in a 30–37°C water bath and is usually pooled for easier administration which takes an additional 10–15 minutes. Cryoprecipitate can be pre-pooled which eases the process of thawing and administration, especially in times of emergency, such as trauma and liver transplantation. After thawing, the cryoprecipitate is maintained between 20–24°C.</p>
                            <h5>Expiration</h5>
                            <p style="color: white;"> Once thawed, a single unit of cryoprecipitate expires in 6 hours; pooled units in open system expire in 4 hours.</p>
                           
                            <h5>Fibrinogen and Factor XIII Concentrate</h5>
                            <p style="color: white;">Lyophilized products are mixed with sterile liquid (water). Product is dissolved then aseptically intravenously administered. Cryoprecipitate is stored at negative 18°C or colder, and has a shelf life of 1 year. For pooled cryo, the expiration date is determined to be 12 months from earliest date of FFP collection.
                            To prepare cryoprecipitate for transfusion, it is thawed quickly at 30-37°C and then stored at room temperature; 20-24°C. Thawed single cryo and pooled cryo which are sterilely manufactured have a shelf life of 6 hours.  Currently thawed cryo cannot be refrozen or refrigerated, due to regulatory standards. Fun fact: refrigeration causes the factors to re-precipitate making it unsuitable for transfusion.</p>

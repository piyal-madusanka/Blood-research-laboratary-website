          <h3>How do I prepare for a creatinine blood test?</h3>
          <p style="color: black;">* A creatinine blood test doesn’t require much preparation. <br>Fasting isn’t necessary.<br> * You can and should eat and drink the same as you do normally to get an accurate result.

<br> * However, it’s important to tell your doctor about any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications you’re currently taking. Some drugs may increase your creatinine levels without causing kidney damage and interfere with your test results. <br>Let your doctor know if you take:

<br> *----cimetidine (Tagamet, Tagamet HB)
<br> *----nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin (Bayer) or ibuprofen (Advil, Midol)
<br> *----chemotherapy drugs
<br> *----cephalosporin antibiotics, such as cephalexin (Keflex) and cefuroxime (Ceftin)
<br> * Your doctor may ask you to stop taking your medication or to adjust your dosage before the test. They’ll also take this into consideration when interpreting your test results.</p>

          <h3>How you prepare for C-reactive protein (CRP) test </h3>
          <p style="color: black;">
* There are no preparations for either a standard CRP test or an hs-CRP test. However, if your blood is being drawn for other tests, as well, you might need to fast or follow other instructions. Ask your doctor if you're having other tests at the same time.
<br>
* Some medications can affect your CRP level. Tell your doctor about the medications you take.
<br>
<br>
* <h4>What you can expect
During the procedure</h4><br>
<p style="color: black;">* Blood is drawn from a vein, usually from your arm. Before the needle is inserted, an elastic band around your upper arm causes the veins in that arm to fill with blood, and the puncture site is cleaned with antiseptic.
<br>
* After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood is collected into a vial or syringe. The band is then removed to restore circulation, and blood continues to flow into the vial. Once enough blood is collected, the needle is removed and the puncture site is covered with a pressure wrap.
<br>
* This relatively painless procedure usually takes only a few minutes.
<br></p>
* <h4>After the procedure</h4> <br>
<p style="color: black;">* After your CRP test, you should be able to drive yourself home and do your normal activities.
<br>
* It can take a few days to get your results. Your doctor should explain to you        what the results of your test mean.
<br>
* If you're having an hs-CRP test is to help find out your heart disease risk, remember that your CRP level is only one risk factor for coronary artery disease. If you have a high CRP level, it doesn't necessarily mean you're at a higher risk of developing heart disease.
<br>
* Talk to your doctor about your other risk factors and ways you can try to prevent coronary artery disease and a heart attack.</p></p>

* Blood glucose tests are either random or fasting tests.
<br>
* For a fasting blood glucose test, you can’t eat or drink anything but water for eight hours before your test. You may want to schedule a fasting glucose test first thing in the morning so you don’t have to fast during the day. You may eat and drink before a random glucose test.
<br>
* Fasting tests are more common because they provide more accurate results and are easier to interpret.
<br>
* Before your test, tell your doctor about the medications you’re taking, including prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, and herbal supplements. Certain medications can affect blood glucose levels. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking a particular medication or to change the dosage before your test temporarily.
<br>
* Medications that can affect your blood glucose levels include:
<br>
* corticosteroids
<br> * diuretics
<br> * birth control pills
<br> * hormone therapy
<br> * antipsychotics
<br> * epinephrine (Adrenalin)
<br> * monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
<br> * sulfonylurea medications
<br> * Severe stress can also cause a temporary increase in your blood glucose and is usually due to one or more of these factors:

<br> * trauma
<br> * heart attack
<br> * You should tell your doctor if you’ve recently had any of these.

However, if you’re having a complete lipid profile done, you should avoid eating or drinking anything other than water for nine to 12 hours before your test.
<br> * Before your test, you should also tell your doctor about:
